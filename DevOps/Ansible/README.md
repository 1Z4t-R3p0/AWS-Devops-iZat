#  Introduction to Ansible

##  What is Ansible?

**Ansible** is a powerful, open-source automation tool used by DevOps engineers and system administrators to:

- âœ… Configure servers
- âœ… Deploy applications
- âœ… Manage infrastructure (bare-metal, virtual, cloud)
- âœ… Orchestrate multi-machine environments

---

### âš¡ Key Features

- **Agentless**  
  > No agent/software is needed on the target machines. Ansible connects using native protocols like SSH or WinRM.

- **Written in Python**  
  > Easy to extend, script, or debug.

- **Declarative & Idempotent**  
  > Repeatable runs wonâ€™t cause duplication or errors.

- **Playbooks written in YAML**  
  > Human-readable and version-controlled.

##  How Ansible Connects to Nodes

| OS      | Protocol | Port     |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Linux**   | SSH      | 22       |
| **Windows** | WinRM    | 5985 (HTTP), 5986 (HTTPS) |

> âœ… You only need **Ansible on the control node**. The managed systems must be accessible via SSH or WinRM.

#  Push vs Pull Model in Automation

| Tool     | Model | Description                            |
|----------|-------|----------------------------------------|
| **Puppet**  | Pull  | Nodes (agents) **pull** configurations from the Puppet master |
| **Ansible** | Push  | The control node **pushes** commands to nodes via SSH/WinRM |

> Ansible **can also use pull mode** via `ansible-pull`, but the push method is default and most common.
